# Same line declarations

You can declare multiple variables on the same line:

```js
let miles = 80276, org = "Tesla";
```

This is exactly the same as writing them on separate lines:

```js
let miles = 80276;
let org = "Tesla";
```

Both styles are valid; many teams prefer one variable per line for readability, especially when there are several variables.
