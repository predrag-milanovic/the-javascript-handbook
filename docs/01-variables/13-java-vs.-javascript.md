# Java vs. JavaScript

A very common misconception is that Java and JavaScript are the same, or even just similar. They are not.

> Java is to JavaScript as car is to carpet.

The names are close, but the languages are different and often used for different kinds of tasks.

## Java

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is a **statically typed**, **object-oriented** language. It compiles to bytecode and runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

Java is commonly used for:
- server-side / backend applications
- Android apps
- large enterprise systems

Java code is usually written, compiled, then run on any machine that has a JVM.

## JavaScript

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a **dynamically** and **weakly typed** language. It originally ran only in the browser, but today it also runs outside the browser thanks to runtimes like **Node.js**, **Deno**, and **Bun**.

JavaScript is commonly used for:
- interactive behavior in web pages
- backend APIs and services (with Node.js and similar runtimes)
- tooling (CLIs, build tools, scripts)

JavaScript was named "JavaScript" in the 90s when Java was very popular, mainly for marketing reasons, not because the languages are closely related.

## Fun fact

[Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), the creator of JavaScript, reportedly had only about **10 days** to design the first version of the language. He was asked to make it look a bit like Java, but run inside the browser. The rest is history.
